## How to use this curriculum

This roadmap is designed for complete beginners who want to build a solid, college-level understanding of Ancient History through independent self-study. It is organized into eleven sections (I through XI).

### Core Sections

These sections form the essential foundation of the discipline. They give you the basic chronological spine of ancient history plus the most important skills and concepts needed to understand the field coherently.

1. I. Historical Method & Evidence  
   Start here. This section teaches you how historians think, how we know what we know, and how to work with ancient evidence. It is the most important starting point.

2. II. Prehistory and the First Societies (before 3000 BCE)  
   Move to this next. It covers the very beginning of human societies before the first cities and writing systems.

3. III. The First Civilizations (3000–1500 BCE)  
   Read this entire section. It introduces the earliest complex societies that set the patterns for everything that follows.

4. IV. The Age of Empires (1500–300 BCE)  
   Continue here. This covers the major empires and cultural developments during the later Bronze Age and early Iron Age.

5. V. Rome and the Mediterranean (300 BCE – 300 CE)  
   Finish the core chronological narrative with the rise and peak of the Roman world.

These five sections (I–V) give you a complete, chronological overview of ancient history from human origins to the height of the classical world. Work through them in order before moving to anything else.

### Specialization Tracks – Optional Deeper or Thematic Exploration

The remaining sections (VI through XI) are not required for a good general understanding. They are specialization tracks that let you go deeper into specific aspects of ancient history.

- VI. Economy, Society, and Power
- VII. Warfare, Technology, and Administration
- VIII. Late Antiquity (300–700 CE)
- IX. Comparative Empires & Global Systems
- X. Working with Ancient Sources
- XI. Research & Writing
